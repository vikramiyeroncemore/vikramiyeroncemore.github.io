Since February 2023, I have been managing an Instagram page called [thefloraofindia](https://www.instagram.com/thefloraofindia/). The premise is straightforward: I photograph and post one plant from India's flora (which has ~20,000 species) for each post, with no repetitions. Over the days, this page has covered over 600 plant species of India, with field notes, identifying features, and other information that might be of interest.
