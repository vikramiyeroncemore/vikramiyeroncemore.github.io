The Instagram page [thefloraofindia](https://www.instagram.com/thefloraofindia/) has been something I started in February 2023 and continue to run. India's flora comprises over 20,000 species, and from this stems (no pun intended) the premise of the page: each post comprises one personally photographed plant from the flora of India with no repetitions. I have covered over 600 plant species so far.

Alongside photos are field notes, along with other points of interest: identifying features, culturally relevant information, and so on.

Many of these plants have been photographed as part of trips made to various regions. Following are some highlights from some trips made so far.
