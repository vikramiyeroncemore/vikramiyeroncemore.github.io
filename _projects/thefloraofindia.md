I have been running an Instagram page called [thefloraofindia](https://www.instagram.com/thefloraofindia/), which I started back in February 2023. The premise is straightforward: I photograph and post one plant from India's flora (which has ~20,000 species) for each post, with no repetitions. This page has covered over 600 plant species of India since, with each post having field notes, identifying features, and other information that might be of interest.
